# Trading App - High-Level Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

### What We're Building
An intelligent financial insights platform that aggregates market news and forecasts from multiple sources, identifies patterns and correlations, tracks source accuracy over time, and provides real-time alerts when high-confidence investment opportunities emerge.

### Key Objectives
1. **Data Aggregation**: Automatically collect and organize financial news and forecasts from diverse web sources
2. **Intelligence Layer**: Detect correlations, conflicts, and patterns across multiple sources to surface high-confidence insights
3. **Credibility System**: Track historical accuracy and allow user-defined weighting of information sources
4. **Real-time Alerts**: Notify users immediately when significant opportunities are identified
5. **Intuitive Visualization**: Present complex financial data in clear, actionable formats

### Success Criteria
- Successfully scrape and aggregate data from at least 5-10 diverse financial sources
- Correlation detection identifies when 3+ sources align on similar ideas with >80% confidence
- Historical accuracy tracking covers at least 6 months of data with measurable performance metrics
- Real-time notifications delivered within 5 minutes of new high-confidence opportunities
- User engagement metrics show regular active usage and positive feedback

### Tech Stack & Architecture

**Backend (Python)**
- Crawl4ai for intelligent web scraping
- FastAPI or Flask for REST API
- Background job scheduler (Celery/APScheduler) for periodic scraping
- NLP libraries for text analysis and correlation detection

**Database (PostgreSQL via Supabase)**
- Structured storage for scraped data, sources, predictions, and user preferences
- Time-series optimization for historical tracking
- Full-text search capabilities

**Frontend (Next.js/React)**
- Server-side rendering for performance
- TailwindCSS for responsive UI
- Chart.js for data visualization and trend analysis
- Real-time updates via WebSocket or polling

**Notifications (OneSignal)**
- Push notifications for web and mobile
- User preference management

**Deployment**
- Vercel for Next.js frontend
- Railway/Render for Python backend
- Supabase for managed PostgreSQL

**Architecture Approach**: Microservices-style separation with backend handling data collection/analysis, frontend focusing on presentation, and database as central data store. Event-driven design for real-time updates.
